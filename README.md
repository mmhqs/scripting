## Python script ideas ðŸ’» 

Hi!

Here you'll find some of my favorite scripts for Windows :)

To execute them, just open your terminal and type:
`python script-title`

Have fun.

- [Temporary folder cleanup](/tempFolderCleanup.py): automatically cleans the Windows temporary files folder, freeing up space (obs: improvement idea -> add trash cleaning too).
- Disk usage monitor: sends a notification if the free space on a partition falls below a defined threshold (e.g., 10 GB).
- Quick script launcher: creates a simple menu in Terminal (using the click module) to select and run any of your small automation scripts.
- CPU/RAM usage monitor: displays real-time system resource usage in Terminal (or saves it to a log) using the psutil library.
