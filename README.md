## Python script ideas 💻 

Hi!

Here you'll find some of my favorite scripts for Windows :)

To execute them, just open your terminal and type:
`python script-title`

Have fun.

- 📁 [Temporary folder cleanup](/tempFolderCleanup.py): automatically cleans the Windows temporary files folder, freeing up space.

To do:
- Disk usage monitor: sends a notification if the free space on a partition falls below a defined threshold (e.g., 10 GB).
- Quick script launcher: creates a simple menu in Terminal (using the click module) to select and run any of your small automation scripts.
- CPU/RAM usage monitor: displays real-time system resource usage in Terminal (or saves it to a log) using the psutil library.
- Automatic translator: uses an API (such as DeepL or Google Translate) to translate large amounts of text.
- PDF Merger: combines multiple PDFs into one.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter: reads documents or articles aloud.
- Speech-to-Text (STT) Converter: transcribes meetings or recordings.
- Email/Password Leak Checker (via HaveIBeenPwned API).

To improve: 
- Temporary folder cleanup improvement idea -> add trash and cache cleaning options.
